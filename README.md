# Smart Traffic Control

This repository contains the source code and documentation for a smart traffic control system.

The system utilizes reinforcement-learning algorithms and game-theory concepts to optimize traffic flow and improve efficiency on road networks.

We used OpenAI's gym as our main platform, combining it with [pyRDDLGym](https://github.com/ataitler/pyRDDLGym) for easy, pythonic, environment creation.
